socket.io chat application tutorial
===========
This is the basic [chat application tutorial](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) from socket.io. It requires almost no basic prior knowledge of Node.JS or Socket.IO, so itâ€™s ideal for users of all knowledge levels. Sockets were needed for my team final project at Makers Academy and that's why I did that first tutorial.

Objectives of exercise
----
To learn about sockets and how to use them.

Technologies used
----
- Javascript
- Node.JS
- Socket.IO

How to run it
----
Please make sure that Node.JS is installed.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:GBouffard/sockets_io_tutorial.git

- You can now open 2 browsers on localhost:3000; and the chat works in real time.
